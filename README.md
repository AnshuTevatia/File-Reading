Introduction:Efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. File handling plays a key role in being able to manage such data, and Python allows us to handle various file formats which are used to store such data.
This project is about how to load, modify, and save files of three popular file formats which are used in the industry to handle data. These formats are:CSV,JSON and TXT.

Problem Statement:The goal is to read data from popular file formats (.csv, .txt, .json), to perform operations on this data, and to finally save this modified data into the original file formats.
